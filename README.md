# Listeners & Handlers

Welcome.

This repository contains a whole bunch of mini-websites for you to study and practice developing.  Each one has a few listeners and handlers with blanks to fill in, and each one is organized the same way. The goal of these exercises isn't to create mind-blowing projects.

Instead the goal to get lots of practice reading code, debugging and stepping through in the debugging.

There are 2 sets of exercises:

* [Exercise 1](./exercise-1)
* [Exercise 2](./exercise-2)
* [Exercise 3](./exercise-3)

And 1 example to study:

* [Example](./z-example)
